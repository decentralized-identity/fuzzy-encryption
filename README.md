# Fuzzy Encryption
A variant of a Fuzzy Vault cryptographic scheme, designed for generating secrets that can be more easily recovered by humans. The full algorithm is described in detail in the [whitepaper](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/fuzzy-encryption/blob/master/fuzzy-encryption-construction.pdf).

## Python Implementation
